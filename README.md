[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the newspaper icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "Hide LinkedIn News." If you navigate to `linkedin.com/feed` while logged in, on the left-hand side of the page you shoudl no longer see "Impressions of your post" or "Profile views." If you have a business account, you should no longer see "Page notifications" or "Page visitors" on the left-hand side, either.
